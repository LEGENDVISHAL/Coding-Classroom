# Coding Classroom 💻📚

> Platform for both teachers and students where they can share and submit programming (coding) assignments.

### Features:
For teachers
1. Create classrooms.
2. Allow the students to join the classroom (using a class code).
3. Remove students from classrooms (if required).

4. Write your code in a user-friendly code editor which supports syntax highlighting, bracket completion and many visual themes.

### Tools Used
Backend
- [Flask]
- [Flask-SQLAlchemy]
- [Subprocess] module (Python) (for executing the code.)
- [Bcrypt] (for password hashing.)

Frontend
- [Bootstrap 4]
- [Jinja] templating
- [CodeMirror] API (for the awesome code editor.)


## Note
> This project is just a simple attempt at creating a code executing API.
> **Executing code given from strangers on your computer (or server) can be dangerous.** Security vulnerabilities have not been throughly checked, so be cautious.

### Installation
> Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
```
$ cd Coding-Classroom
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python server.py
```
_(If you get any python or pip not found errors, try using python3 or pip3 instead)_

Using a Python virtual environment is recommended

```
$ python -m venv coding-venv
$ source coding-venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Todo
- Optimize the assignment execution time.
- Find any security related issues in the solve them.
